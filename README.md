# phantomjs-worker

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/flux-s/phantomjs-worker.svg)](https://travis-ci.org/flux-s/phantomjs-worker)

*A docker image containing a very simple REST service for document conversion and rendering using phantomjs.*

This is mostly intended as a worker for [flux-templating](https://github.com/flux-s/flux-templating) but can be used independently.
